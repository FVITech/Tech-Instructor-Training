#General procedures

##Initial on-boarding requirements

1. Requirements to complete before you teach your first class:
  1. Complete a classroom observation
  2. Create a sample lesson plan
  3. You must read this document before teaching your first class as well. You may be required to complete an assessment based on the materials covered herein.
  4. Complete the [online instructor training](https://github.com/FVITech/General-Procedures-Tooling/blob/master/onboarding.md)
2. Ensure the business office has a current copy of your transcripts, professional credentials, resume, notarized CIE form, and any other paperwork they might need within 30 days of your start date.

##On-Going Job requirements
1. Upon first starting all instructors will be paid hourly. As a technology instructor your allotted weekly workload is 25 hours, of which 20 hours are classroom time. You shouldn't have to clock in or out.
2. **You must approve your hours for the week every Friday.**  Your program director will do his/her best to remind you of this during weekly faculty meetings but it is ultimately your responsibility. In order to approve your hours, you must visit this page http://webclock.biz/prod/FLV01/home.cfm and use the employee number and PIN provided by the business office.
3. Instructors teaching the night class: If you leave even 4 seconds after 10:30pm, it is **your responsibility** to ensure that **all doors to FVI are locked.** Our institution **incurs monetary fines** for leaving the doors open overnight and it is of utmost importance that we all show consideration for this and do our best to prevent this from happening.
4. If there is a holiday on a given week (eg. 4th of July), this means your hours will come down to 20 rather than 25. In other words, part time instructors don't have paid holidays.
5. You are **required** to develop at least four formative assessments and two summative assessments per three-week unit and submit these to your program director. Further details on developing effective assessments will be under the [pedagogical training](pedagogy.md) section of this document.
6. FVI has monthly and quarterly luncheons where we share the progress we are making towards accomplishing our goal and vision of making high quality careers accessible to everyone regardless of income level or heritage. You are *strongly encouraged* to attend.
