# Tech Instructor Training

This repository is organized by topics and will be developed incrementally:

1. General procedures and things to know (this document)
2. [Pedagogical training](pedagogy.md)
3. [Grading Policies](grading.md)

# General procedures

## Initial on-boarding requirements

1. Requirements to complete before you teach your first class:
  1. Complete a classroom observation
  2. Create a sample lesson plan
  3. You must read this document before teaching your first class as well. You may be required to complete an assessment based on the materials covered herein.
  4. Complete the [online instructor training](https://github.com/FVITech/General-Procedures-Tooling/blob/master/onboarding.md)
2. Ensure the business office has a current copy of your transcripts, professional credentials, resume, notarized CIE form, and any other paperwork they might need within 30 days of your start date.

## On-Going Job requirements
1. Upon first starting all instructors will be paid hourly. As a technology instructor your allotted weekly workload is 25 hours, of which 20 hours are classroom time. You shouldn't have to clock in or out.
2. **You must approve your hours for the week every Friday.**  Your program director will do his/her best to remind you of this during weekly faculty meetings but it is ultimately your responsibility. In order to approve your hours, you must visit this page http://webclock.biz/prod/FLV01/home.cfm and use the employee number and PIN provided by the business office.
3. Instructors teaching the night class: If you leave even 4 seconds after 10:30pm, it is **your responsibility** to ensure that **all doors to FVI are locked.** Our institution **incurs monetary fines** for leaving the doors open overnight and it is of utmost importance that we all show consideration for this and do our best to prevent this from happening.
4. If there is a holiday on a given week (eg. 4th of July), this means your hours will come down to 20 rather than 25. In other words, part time instructors don't have paid holidays.
5. You are **required** to develop at least two formative assessments and two summative assessments per three-week unit and submit these to your program director. Further details on developing effective assessments will be under the [pedagogical training](pedagogy.md) section of this document.
6. FVI has monthly and quarterly luncheons where we share the progress we are making towards accomplishing our goal and vision of making high quality careers accessible to everyone regardless of income level or heritage. You are *strongly encouraged* to attend.
7. If a student is late 4x in a row or misses 2x in a week, the instructor is responsible for filling out a student advising form, documenting the fact that the student is in danger of failing the course and documenting the steps that the student will commit to take in order to catch up.
8. If a student fails the first exam in a unit, the instructor is responsible for filling out a student advising form.

# Job Scorecard
Your periodic performance reviews will be based on two aspects. First, you will be reviewed based on how you fit FVI's core values, then you will be held accountable to the attainment of a specific level of pedagogical proficiency and execution defined in your job scorecard.

## Core Values
1. Self Starter. Do you tackle and solve problems on your own and do what it takes in order to maximize student learning? Do you constantly improve yourself and your curriculum and add new teaching methods and materials every time you teach a class?  
2. Accountability for task completion. Do you complete tasks as instructed and if not are you able to constructively be held accountable?
3. Develop individuals to their highest level of aspiration. Do you foster an environment of self betterment amongst our students? Do you embody an image of perpetual self-betterment?  
4. Positive and clear Communication. Do you avoid all gossip and negative banter? When you have an issue or a disagreement with a policy or team member, do you bring it up to the right person and try to solve it or do you just complain to other team members?  
5. Exceed expectations: Self explanatory. Don't be lazy and don't leave our student experience half finished.  
6. Giving back to the community, including our students.  

## Job Scorecard
1. Ensure 80% attendance. You must keep students engaged and motivated enough to come to class. You may use attendance as a "weapon" to help motivate students only to the degree prescribed in the [Grading guidelines](grading.md). Various classroom duties fall under this category:  
    * Being prepared for class
    * Starting class on time
    * Keeping students on task - guiding them constantly rather than letting them roam too freely

2. Ensure portfolio/project completion. This category is multifaceted:
    * You must help students develop high quality portfolio items they can showcase. In the case of infrastructure instructors, half of your portfolio development duties will consist on preparing students for certifications.  
    * The portfolio items you develop should be refined overtime. You must strive to help students produce at least one portfolio-worthy item per three-week course. The quality of your portfolio items will be judged on how well they illustrate the stated learning objective of the course (Angular, CSS, Networking, etc) plus at least one of the following concepts:  
      * Effective design and implementation of markup (WD)  
      * Interaction with APIs (WD)  
      * Programmatic DOM manipulation (WD)  
      * Resale ability for the student (both programs)  
      * Relevancy to certification (IT)  
      * Difficulty level being attuned to student skill (your program director may conduct student interviews where he/she gauges whether the student understands his/her portfolio or he/she just followed it along like a udemy tutorial).  

3. Document, expand, and execute lesson plans. Your curriculum should be an ever expanding and evolving repository of formative assessments, resources (videos, slide presentations, etc), and summative assessments. Your lesson plans should be well documented and given to students at the start of each course. You may see examples of the level of detail a lesson plan should have in the WEB2010 Repository. This criterion will be judged on:  
    * How well did you execute the curriculum?  
    * How many teaching methods did you use throughout the unit? Acceptable teaching methods/tools include but are not limited to the following:  
      * Formative assessments  
      * Summative assessments  
      * Curated videos  
      * Curated exercises  
      * Guided projects  
      * Unguided projects  
      * Differentiated projects (higher complexity for better students)  
      * Individually guided projects  
      * Homeworks  
    * The **most** important criterion in judging the success of lesson plan execution is whether the level of proficiency of the student matches the letter grade outcome of the course. In particular, the following things are **absolutely unacceptable**:
      * A student who did no homework and doesn't already have a CS bachelors getting an A for a class (it is understandable to not want to bore a bachelors-degree holder with introductory busywork)  
      * A student who misses 3+ days in the unit getting an A  
      * A student with poor command of the assessed material getting an A or B  
4. Iteratively develop curriculum. Besides constantly adding new teaching tools to assist in the enhancement of an already-defined curriculum, it is your responsibility to stay abreast with topics in the industry and suggest enhancements to the material and curriculum we present to our students. Your curriculum development will be judged in terms of:  
    * Relevancy to the South Florida job market  
    * Relevancy to our student demographic and the program objectives (don't be teaching clojure or R in the Web Developer program, don't teach data center fabric deployment automation in the IT program)  
    * How the portfolio items of your curriculum stack up against those in the previous curriculum iteration  
    * Thoughtfulness of the iteration: completely tossing a curriculum  is frowned upon. A measured, patient and step-wise approach is strongly recommended.  
    * Not creating unnecessary cognitive load. Again, teaching things that our students are unlikely to use creates a learning burden that we do not easily accept.
