## Chapter 2: The Power of Forgetting

"A brain is a brain is a brain, and healthy ones all work the same way." With enough preparation and devition, each brain is capable of wizard-like feats of memory. There is no scientific evidence for the existence of "photographic memory." 

The process of forgetting actually helps you focus because it blocks irrelevant facts when trying to recall important things. We assume forgetting is all bad, but more often forgetting is a friend of learning. Retrieving a memory alters its accessibility and changes its contest. There is a "Forget to learn" theory that tries to explain ways in which forgetting aids the learning process. 

There is a forgetting curve that charts the rate at which memories fade over time. Ebbinghouse created a catalog of nonsense sounds and created a 2300 possible syllables. He put together lists of the syllables and studied them for hundreds of hours. He came up with an equation of the memory forgetting curve.

After one day, when learning totally new information, only 25% is retained. But Ebbinghouse only studied nonsense syllables. It doesnt work the same way with real world learning.

The chapter presents an exercise to memorize this passage for 5 minutes straight:

At daybreak on the bleak sea beach, a fisherman stood aghast
To see the form of a maiden fair, lash close to a drifting mast
The salt sea was frozen on her breast, the salt tears in her eyes,
And he saw her hair like the brown sea-weed, on the billows fall and rise  
Such was the wreck of Hesperus, in the midnight and the snow!
Christ save us all from a death like this, on the reef of Norman's woe!

After working on that for 5 minutes you are supposed to get up, distract yourself for another 5 minutes, then try to recall it from memory. Then test yourself tomorrow again. You should do better the day after than 5mins after.

Memory doesnt only tend towards decay. It has another tendency, towards reminiscence. Like a bubbling up of connections between the things we learned and the things we already knew. The strength of this effect is highly dependent on the material being studied. Disconnected facts don't have it. Stories, pictures, images, and so on, do. The reminiscing effect also lasts only for 2 days so you can't wait a week and expect recall to improve. 

Robert Bjork created the "Theory of disuse." Any memory has a storage strength and a retrieval strength. Storage strength can increase but can never decrease. In other words, it is suspected (but not proven) that our brains retain every single fact that we've ever been exposed to - we store every second of our lives in memory. No memory is ever lost in that it faded away - when we forget something it's because we can't retrieve it. Retrieval strength is a measure of how easily a nugget of information comes to mind. Retrieval strength is much more limited and also improves with studying, but it drops off relatively quickly without reinforcement/studying. Compared to storage, retrieval strength grows quickly but fades quickly. Once a fact or memory is found/retrieved, we learn more. The harder the brain has to work to retrieve a memory, the bigger the learning gains (improvement in storage and retrieval strengths). 

The implication of this is pretty big and awesome. The author uses an example of an australian moving to the US. When the aussie moves, he has to basically forget every driving instinct he has (because they drive on the left side of the road over there) and re-learn to drive. However, if he moves back to Australia, he will have a much easier time re-learning how to drive over there. This is because the knowledge of left-side driving was never actually gone - its storage strength remained high. It simply became more difficult to retrieve. Thus, upon moving back to Australia, he doesn't actually have to re-acquire the knowledge, he merely has to lower the retrieval strength of American driving and icnrease the retrieval strength of aussie driving.

## Chapter 4: Spacing Learning

If two bits of knowledge are of the same strength but of a different age, studying the older one is the best use of your time. In other words, studying something again right after you already studied it does not accomplish much, if anything at all. Studying it an hour later or the next day would be a much better approach. 

There was a foreign language learning experiment that tested long spacing intervals. There were 4 participants, all in the same family of psychologists. Each person had a list of 300 unfamiliar foreign language words and each person broke those lists up into six lists of 50 words. Each group of 50 was studied according to a different schedule: One list was studied every 2 weeks, one list was studied every month, and one list was studied every two months. It was unclear what the interval was for the other 3 lists. For each study session, what they would do was have flash cards with the foreign word on one side and the english translation on the other. Each session entailed drilling each other on the words until there was full recall of all the fifty words they were assigned for that list. This was the first truly long term test of the spacing effect. After five years, the family scored most highly on the words that were studied at a 2-month interval. They did a final exam and got 76% of these words right, while they only scored 56% on the 2-week words. It turns out that partial forgetting helps increases retrieval strength of memories. When you forget more, you find out what your weaknesses are and the things you're forgetting more easily. 

An interesting aside in the chapter was that to learn English you have to learn about 20,000 words and a lot of idioms to go along with them. By some estimates, this entails 2 hours of practice a day for 10 years. Storage of the words and retrieval are different. Being able to quickly retrieve them would take even longer. There was one scientist called wozniak that designed an algorithm for distributed learning as he was trying to learn English. The principle he came up with was that intervals should be short enough to ensure the knowledge is still remembered, but they should be as long as possible in order to make use of the spacing effect. This gave birth to a program called Super-memo, which is apparently very popular and freeware. The basics of his algorithm is: study the material, then review 1-2 days later, then a week later, then a month later. After that, longer intervals. 

In 2008 there was a study on having 1300 people memorize obscure facts. Each participant studied the facts twice, and there were several groups of participants. One that studied the facts with little time, one that studied the facts with a day in between, etc. The longest interval was six months. There were 26 schedules. It turns out that the spacing of your study sessions depends on the test date. If your test is a week from now, you should do a study session today and one tomorrow. If the test is a month from now, you should do a study session today and one a week from now. And so on and so forth. If the test is in 2 months and you can do 3 sessions, you should do a session today, one in 2 weeks, and one the day before the exam. The optimal spacing of study sessions depends on what test you are rpeparing for. This leaves a big question unanswered as to what if you don't care about a test and you want to achieve mastery.

## Chapter 5: Fluency Effect

We know from a prior chapter that the harder your brain has to work to retrieve a memory, the greater the impact in learning. This is why partial forgetting is great. Fluency is the opposite of this effect. Fluency is the illusion that we are subject to when we see a study cue, like for instance a slide deck or outline, and we can quickly recall some of the content. It seems familiar to us. This does not actually mean that we know it, and whenever we experience familiarity with any material, we should challenge ourselves to engage the material in an active way, such as paraphrasing it in writing or explaining it to an imaginary friend. 

When studying to memorize passages and recite them verbatim, there has been some work done in terms of finding out the optimal percentage split between reading time and recitation time. Given a time frame of x, spend the first third of your time memorizing and the other two thirds reciting the information. 

Testing *is* studying, of a different and powerful kind. Testing is a powerful learning device and it should be used sooner rather than later. One hour's time after exposure to the material is enough for a test to have a huge effect on memory and recollection.

At the crux of this whole "Testing effect" is the fact that when we successfully retrieve a memory, we store it again, in a different way. This adds a different neural pathway associated with that memory and strengthens its connections with other knowledge we have acquired since we last recalled it. Using our memory changes our memory in ways we cant anticipate but they are usually super helpful to learning. 

The latest permutation of the testing effect is "pre-testing." Researchers have found that failed attempts at retrieval of a memory create a sort of "hole" that primes your brain for learning the right answer. So taking a test is always a good way to learn, even if you dont know anything.
