#Attaining Peak performance

##Summary

This document will summarize the book "Peak, Secrets From the new Science of Expertise." The purpose of such a summary is for our faculty members to each attain an understanding of the ground-level principles that enable peak performance so that they may use such knowledge to develop an effective teaching style that focuses on enabling students to attain mastery. Each instructor, like each coder, has natural strengths and weaknesses and therefore must tweak the general guidelines herein presented to match their own preferred approach.

##Chapter 1: Introducing practice

For a long time throughout history, we have known about this ability of a "perfect pitch." About one in 10,000 people have the ability to accurately recognize the pitch of any note that is played in a musical instrument. You can blindfold these people and then hit a random key on the piano and they will tell you exactly which musical note it was.

Ever since we found out about the skill of perfect pitch we have thought it to be some kind of innate gift that only a few people were born with, and that you had to get training in music during early childhood to develop it. Thus, we considered perfect pitch to be a product of genetic gifts in addition to early childhood musical training (ages 2-6). That was until some Japanese dude named Sakakibara grabbed that notion by the pussy. This guy ran a study with a bunch of kids ages 2 to 6 and got every single one of them to develop perfect pitch. He did this by following a very well structured practice routine of progressvie difficulty. He started with only a few notes and hammered sound recognition exercises until all those notes were mastered, then move on to more notes, etc., until the kids had mastered perfect pitch.

The training was about 3-5 sessions per day of very short duration, not every day of the week. It took some kids 10 months to develop perfect pitch, and other kids a year and a half, but everyone got it. **Over a year and a half all these kids had perfect pitch. Reflecting on this a little bit and bringing it back to Motzart's experience, we can see Motzart practiced more in one month during his early childhood than the entirety of the time it took these kids to develop perfect pitch.**

This is a very salient point. With the right instruction at the right time, there is essentially no limit to talent.

Another salient point in these first two chapters is that will is not enough. It doesn't matter how badly you want to be the best basketball player in the world, if you're 5'5 and all you do is play 1 on 1's against Lebron James, you will never improve. You must have the right sort of practice, where you follow a structured, methodical plan to overcome your own specific weaknesses. This type of comprehensive practicing methodology has been dubbed **deliberate practice**. (The practice terminology in this document may not be consistent with the terminology in pedagogy.md but the ideas are consistent).

There's a stretch of the book where the author goes through a series of jaw dropping examples of skill attainment. In 1908, some dude smashed the world record for a full marathon at around 2 hours 55 minutes. Experts thought he was nearing the limit of human performance potential. Today, that time would have barely qualified him for the Boston marathon.

In the 1908 olympics, some dude busted himself up trying a double sommersault dive. The press reacted by saying the jump was too dangerous and that it should be banned from the olympics. Today, this dive is within the skill level of thousands of ten-year-olds, and a quadruple sommersault isn't even that difficult of a dive.

In 1920 there was a famous classical virtuoso musician who was recorded playing Chopin and was lauded for his incredible mastery at the time. Today, his recordings are used as examples of how NOT to play Chopin and how to identify sloppiness.

Some fucking dude even memorized 70 thousand digits of pi. It took him over 24 hours just to recite them.

All of this has happened due to the sophistication of training technique and the average amount of practice elite level people undertake nowadays.

There are several types of practice characterized by the mindset of the person practicing and their effectiveness.

The first and most basic type of practice, **naive practice**, is basically when we get some instruction on something (from a teacher, youtube, etc.) and then practice a little bit until the activity becomes second nature. This is how we learn driving, for instance, and how many of us learned sports in elementary school. Practice dribbling, throwing, or catching until it becomes automatic. However, it is a demonstrated fact that once an activity becomes automatic, its mindless repetition leads to no further gains in skill. In fact, when an activity is only repeated automatically, skil decays over time.

It therefore follows that the common assumption that a Doctor, teacher, driver, or runner with 15 years of experience is better than one who has 4 years of experience. Statistically, this is highly unlikely to be the case. In most cases, both the 15 year and the 4 year doctor are practicing mindlessly and therefore no longer attaining skill. The 15 year doctor has had a longer time span for some of his less frequently used skills to decay, so one should expect that he would be worse at his job than a newer Doctor.

The way to avoid this progressive decay in ability is by engaging in **purposeful practice** with a high enough degree of frequency.

What characterizes **purposeful practice** is having a specific goal. Think of a tennis player who can't ever hit a ball if it comes at his chest area. If all this guy does is just play tennis games, he will never improve. EVEN if his playing isn't mindless, he just won't have enough repetition and opportunities to work on his weakness. If instead he asks someone to just fire 100 shots at his chest every day for 2 weeks he is much more likely likely to overcome his weakness and improve his skill.

The notion of the 10,000 hours to mastery is a myth. If a teenage piano student learns enough to play a few songs, but then spends 20 years playing the same songs in the same way at Nordstrom he will never improve. In fact, he will slowly get worse over time.

With all that said, the answer isn't always to try harder and be more mindful, but usually the answer is to have a plan. For instance, there was an anecdote of a music student who wanted to play a specific piece of a violin song at the same speed as played by Itzhak Perlman. She had been trying for weeks to do it and not getting anywhere, her fingers would just get tied up and cramp up. She went to her music teacher for advice, and the music teacher grabbed a metronome and measured the speed of the piece as played by Perlman. She then set the metronome to a slow pace that was well within the student's skill level. The student played the song, and then the teacher slightly increased the metronome and had the student play it again. They repeated this process several times until the teacher showed the metronome setting to the student and it was faster than Perlman's pace. the point here is you can't just ram your head against the wall of a problem you can't solve. And this is essentially what colleges ask CS majors to do for the first 2 years of studying.

Another example of this type of thinking at work was shown through the anecdote of a student undergoing a memory skill development experiment. The student, Steve, was practicing the memorization of digits every day, as a part of an experiment with the book's Author (this experiment is alluded to multiple times). At one point, Steve was stuck with 20 numbers and didn't seem to be able to memorize any more. So the researcher threw him a curve ball and asked him to memorize 30 numbers. Although the student failed, he was able to memorize 24, effectively breaking that mental plateau. Some plateaus are mental, others are skill-based. As instructors we must help our students break through by helping them identify which kind of plateau they are stuck on.

Breaking through plateaus by engaging in purposeful practice is hard work. It requires consistent positive feedback. This is why it is imperative that our classes are always fun.

In summary, purposeful practice can be characterized by:  
* The student must leave his comfort zone  
* The student must be focused, invest much mental energy, and have clear goals  
* The student must have a plan for reaching those goals (that's our job)  
* The student must have a way to monitor progress (that's our jobs, and the huge importance of tests and timely feedback)
* The student must be able to maintain motivation  

###Limits of Purposeful practice

Going back to the digit memorization experiment with Steve, there was another girl who was recruited to this experiment. Although she quickly improved in the beginning, her progress stalled at around 20 numbers for so long that she gave up. Upon analyzing the mental maps and mnemonics that she formed for the purposes of memorization, researchers found that they were all random. She used times of the day and stuff like that. Conversely, Steve, who was able to improve to 82 numbers, used patterns and numbers already in his long term memory. For instance, if he hear the number 907, he would think of that as "a pretty good 2 mile time," rather than something he didn't already have a mental schema for, such as "9:07 am." If he heard the number 400 he would instantly think of "the mythical 4 minute mile."

There was another guy besides Steve and this girl who also joined the experiment. With this guy, Steve was recruited as a coach to train him. This resulted in very quick improvements at first but then the guy stalled at around 30 digits. It was not until he figure out ways to tweak and adapt Steve's techniques that he continued to improve, eventually reaching 100 digits and surpassing his teacher Steve.

When practicing towards the improvement of cognitive tasks, the goal should be to develop mental structures that make it possible to work around the limitations of short term memory and deal with large amounts of information at once. There are many ways to do this and their effectiveness varies from person to person. Invariable, however, one must adapt the methods to ones own circumstances.

Purposeful practice therefore doesn't tell the whole story. One of the elements that's missing from purposeful practice is what separates it from deliberate practice, which is the subject of the next portion of the book.


##Chapter 2: the adaptations to practice

This chapter starts by telling the reader about London and how complicated navigating this city is. It's such an old city it has no structure or grid system. London cab drivers have to be extremely good at navigating, and in fact you're not allowed to become a cabbie in London unless you can pass some ridiculously difficult test where they ask you stuff like "How do you get from place x to the place that has a 1-foot-tall statue of a mouse with cheese?" Therefore, it requires much special mental ability for spatial reasoning and memory to be a cab driver in London. They've researched the brains of London cab drivers and the evidence is extremely strong that London cab drivers start out as normal people but all the navigation training and memorization they do increases the size of their hippocampus in order to enable them to have extraordinary navigation skills.

The limits of what the brain and body can do are oftentimes underestimated. Most really fit people can do 50 to 100 pushups, so one might think that the world record is 1,000 or 1,500. In reality, the world record for nonstop pushups is over 10,500. Same goes for pullups, some dude has done a few thousand even though most people can't do one and fit people usually do 10-15.

Blind people present interesting example of the bridge between physical and brain adaptations. They've studied braille instructors to find that their fingers are incredibly sensitive to touch. They can register a touch pressure so light it's almost non existent and normal people would never even come close to sensing it. However, normal people can easily differentiate when different fingers are touched. It's easy for us to identify when we are feeling pressure in our index finger vs our ring finger. However, these braille masters lose this ability. It turns out that the neural networks they use for feeling touch on their fingers grow so much to the point they overlap, and they lose the ability to differentiate between fingers. **This is a key point. By striving for success in one thing, we sacrifice other abilities.** Indeed, even those London cab drivers have been observed to lose the ability to memorize certain kinds of things to the point that their ability in this area is very much under average. In order to be able to memorize all these streets, landmarks, and navigation patterns they sacrifice the ability to memorize 2-dimensional shapes.

Another super interesting example of the unanticipated power of neuroplasticity is an experiment where scientists gathered a bunch of middle aged people with presbyopia and had them do some kind of visual exercises for 30mins 3x a week. After 3 months, the subjects who previously couldn't see anything up close were able to read without glasses. This happened because they better trained their brain to see contrast and apply "software fixes." Their actual eye hardware didn't change.

Bodily adaptations are pretty well understood. The gist of it is that in order to elicit adaptation you must push your body past its limit for a certain duration of time. A muscle doesn't grow from lifting 3lb pink dumbells and you will never become able to run a marathon by running 100 yards a day. The mechanisms by which this actually happens are prety well understood at the cellular level - ATP depletion, micro-tears of muscle fibers, a bunch of stuff like that.

Neurological adaptations are not as well understood but it seems like the principles are the same. You must push past your comfort zone in order to create neural adaptations. What we do know about the physiology of neuroplasticity is that new neurons don't really pop up. What happens is neural network connections are form, and the brain can also increase the amount of myelin it has. Myelin is a protein that surrounds many nerve fibers which increases the speed at which they can communicate.

So, the greater the challenge the greater the neural changes we can elicit, up to a point. Of course if we push ourselves too much we risk burnout. We have scientifically observed physiological brain adaptations in many fields, including the following:

* Pilots have a certain region of the brain more developed than normal people  
* String musicians have larger cerebellums and the brain circuits that control their left hand fingers are much bigger than normal  
* Mathematicians have a specific area of the brain where their cerebral cortex is thicker  
* Divers have a thicker cerebral cortex in an area of the brain associated with body-spatial awareness.

Some important bulletpoints about cerebral adaptation:  
* Younger brains are more adaptable. By starting training in something at a young age what you are essentially doing is like re-directing the branch of a sapling. You can push it over 1mm and significantly alter the shape of the grown tree. With a grown tree, if you push one of its branches even one whole meter, you may not achieve the same effect.  
* As you develop mastery in something you **will** regress in another area. As I become an increasingly devoted coder I have noted it takes significant mental effort for me to even catch a fast-moving ball.  
* The neural changes you elicit through practice of a mental discipline require upkeep. They studied retired London cab drivers and found that their hippocampi were significantly shrunken compared to active cab drivers. However, they were still more developed than those of people who were never cab drivers.

Most people live in the area of "good enough." They learn a little bit about some job, enough to not get fired, and stay at that skill level forever. This is largely due to laziness but also to a lack of growth mindset, where people think talent is fixed and once their skill level naturally plateaus, there's little they can do about it. Purposeful and deliberate practice are instruments we can use in order to *increase our talent* at particular pursuits. What characterizes deliberate practice is the subject of the next few chapters.
